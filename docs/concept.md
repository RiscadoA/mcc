# Concept 1

Simulated island with politics and in which every inhabitant is a simulated NPC.
The player should be able to interact with the NPCs and change the course of history.

Every NPC has a set of properties which dictate his behaviour:
- age;
- gender;
- family;
- charisma;
- loyalty;
- strength;
- skills (one per job, can go from 0 to 10);

# Concept 2

Infinite dungeon like map.
